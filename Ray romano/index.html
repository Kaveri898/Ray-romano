      <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: <i> UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</i></h2><br><br>
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
        eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone.
        It is CRAZY. But <br />we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
        Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

      <p>
        "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
        great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
        before we know <br />it, there will be another "Everybody loves
        Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"

      <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: <i> DOUBLED THE VALUE</i></h2><br><br>
      <p>
        "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
        pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>
        renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home
        improvements."
